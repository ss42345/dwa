<h1> P4 Proposal </h1>
<h2> Stock Trading Signals </h2>
<h2>Description </h2>
<p>
    This is a continuation of my P3 project with some new additional features. <br><br>
    The main idea is to come up with a simple tool that will tell user whether he/she should buy or sell a
    particular stock. This analysis will take into account the stock history, the current market conditions and
    some custom numerical metrics to come up with the final recommendation.
</p>

<p>
    As compared to p3, here are some additional features:
    <UL>
    <li>
        Users will have to setup an account and login
    </li>
    <li>
        Users can choose the stock ticker symbol. The stock history data will be downloaded automatically
    </li>
    <li>
        Users can choose some additional metrics like MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) which will provide
        additional trading signals.
    </li>
    <li>
        A superimposed chart of the price history and the chosen metrics will be shown in the chart area.
        This will give users a better visual cue.
    </li>
    <li>
        Time permitting, additional capability will be added that will allow users to create a watch-list of stocks.
    </li>

    </UL>
